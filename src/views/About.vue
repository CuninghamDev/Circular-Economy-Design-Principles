        <h3>About The Circular Economy Toolkit</h3>
        <p>
          This toolkit is one of the products of an ongoing R+D effort by
          Cuningham Group. This work reflects a broader push across our studios
          and design practices to embody the principles of regenerative design.
        </p>
        <p>
          This toolkit grew out of previous research efforts including an
          extensive literature review, a self assessment of several of our past
          designs, and internal deliberations regarding how circularity can
          begin to be implemented in conventional design projects. Currently
          this toolkit includes an interactive diagram that visualizes common
          ways circular economy principles can be applied in the built
          environment, and links to numerous external resources that can help
          someone get up to speed on the details of these topics.
